# urlshort
##URL Shortener Project for Free Code Camp  
* This is a project I undertook to start to learn Node.js and databases, specifically MongoDB.  
When up and running via Heroku, you just add:  
<em>/urls/new?fullUrl=<span class="api">http://desiredUrl</em> in order to make it work.   
* Basically the full address should look like this:  
<em>https://url-shortjoehill.herokuapp.com/urls/new?fullUrl=http://test.com</em>  
* This will take your desired URL and shorten it to a 5 digit code.   
Once you see the 5 digit code for "shortenedUrl", You add in the short url at <em>/urls/</em> and then you hit enter, and you should be redeirected!
